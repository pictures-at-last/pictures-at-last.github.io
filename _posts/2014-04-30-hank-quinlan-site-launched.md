Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Not sure if Jekyll updates when it should though. Doesn't seem to - even this text isn't showing. Or this.
